                This app outputs a computer-generated Bernie Sanders speech. It uses a primitive artificial intelligence model, 
                called a Markov model, to learn from his previous speeches. Get him going with a starting topic too!

            Contact Tracing App
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                During COVID, we weren't allowed to eat lunch indoors because of the risk of viral spread. 
                At the request of the administraion, I designed and built a contact-tracing app interface and database  
                that was actually implemented school-wide during 2021. 
                The program used QR codes posted on lunch rooms to 
                record where students ate each day, 
                and stored the information in a database. After students filled out the form, it thanked them with a randomly generated affirmation. 
                There is also a portal for administrators to easily access the information. The 
                linked site is a mock up of the original site, but doesn't link to the database.

                As our school newspaper transitioned to the web we needed an effective way to reach readers. So I developed and 
                implemented a newsletter template that we send out weekly. It distributes the articles written over the course of the week
                to the entire student body and faculty as well as our 3,000 web subscribers.
