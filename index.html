                This app outputs a computer-genearted Bernie Sanders speech. It uses a primitive artificial intelligence model, 
                called a Markov model, to learn from him previous speeches. Get him going with a starting topic too!

            Contact Tracing App
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                During COVID, we we're allowed to eat lunch indoors because of the risk of viral spread. 
                The administration wanted us to design a program to monitor where student ate lunch so 
                that in the case of a positive case, they could contact trace. The program uses QR codes posted on lunch rooms to 
                record where students ate each day, 
                and stores the information in a database. There is also an portal for administrators to easily access the information. The 
                linked site is a mock up of the original site, but doesn't link to the database.

                Augur Bit Newsletter Design

            <div class="text">
                As our school newspaper transitioned to the web we needed an effective way to reach readers. So I developed and 
                implemented a newsletter template that we send out weekly. It sends all of the articles written over the course of the weekly
                to the enture student body and faculty along with our 3,000 web subscribers.
